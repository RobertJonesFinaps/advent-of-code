# Advent of code

This is a collection of scripts to solve the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.
Extremely basic setup for a couple of scripts, with at least some typesafety.

## Setup

Source code in src, with scripts labelled to match the challenge.

Run your favourite typescript compiler.

Output javascript files (dist/< year >/< challenge number >) should be able to be pasted directly into the console of the corresponding data input.
